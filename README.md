Find a Pair is a simple memory matching game where players need to find matching pairs of images hidden behind cards. The game offers three difficulty levels: easy, normal, and hard. The objective is to clear all the cards by matching all the pairs.

The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### While working on this project, I practiced and learned several key aspects of web development and JavaScript programming. Here are the things I gained experience in during the development of the Find a Pair game:

* **DOM Manipulation**: I worked extensively with the Document Object Model (DOM) to select and manipulate HTML elements dynamically. This allowed me to update the game's interface, change card states, and handle user interactions effectively.

* **Event Handling**: I utilized event listeners to respond to user interactions, such as clicking on cards and buttons. This helped me implement game logic and control the flow of the game based on user actions.

* **CSS and Styling**: I honed my skills in styling and designing the game interface using CSS. I used CSS classes and animations to create visually appealing transitions, card rotations, and win state effects.

* **Array Manipulation**: The game involved managing arrays to store card information, track user moves, and handle comparisons between cards. I practiced array methods like push(), pop(), and splice() to manipulate the data effectively.

* **Asynchronous Programming**: I implemented asynchronous functions to handle timeouts for card flips, matching animations, and victory sound effects. This helped to enhance user experience and maintain game flow.

* **Conditional Statements and Loops**: The game's logic heavily relied on conditional statements (e.g., if, else) and loops (e.g., for) to check card matches, implement game modes, and handle win conditions.

* **Randomization**: I used randomization techniques to shuffle the card images at the beginning of the game, ensuring each playthrough had a unique arrangement of cards.

* **Audio Integration**: I integrated audio files with the game using the Audio object in JavaScript. This allowed me to add sound effects for card flips, correct matches, and victory.

* **Timer Implementation**: I learned how to create a timer using setInterval() to keep track of the player's time spent in the game.

* **Game Flow Management**: I practiced designing and structuring the game's flow, such as displaying game rules, hiding and showing elements at different game stages, and managing the restart process.

* **Code Organization**: I improved my ability to organize and structure code effectively. This included breaking down the program into smaller functions, modularizing code, and using comments for clarity.

* **Debugging**: Throughout development, I encountered and fixed various bugs and issues. This experience improved my debugging skills and taught me how to troubleshoot problems effectively.

Overall, working on the Find a Pair game provided valuable hands-on experience in web development, JavaScript, and game design. The project challenged me to implement various features and taught me practical ways to handle interactions in a web application.
