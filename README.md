This is a game of finding matching pairs of pictures. There are three levels of difficulty, a timer, small sound effects and result tracking.

### Developing this project, I practiced the following:
* Working with functions (writing main and auxiliary functions);
* Flag variables;
* Data attributes and adding elements to the page based on their values;
* Conditional styling;
* Event listeners. While working with them, I encountered a problem where a certain event (click) wasn't triggered on child elements. I was able to quickly identify this problem and found a solution by searching for it online.

The main difficulty in working on this project was in developing the logic for comparing cards. I solved this problem by breaking it down into smaller sub-tasks. This way, I was able to create a logical chain of actions that ultimately fulfilled all the intended functionality.
