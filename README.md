## [Find a Pair (Game)](vch-sh.github.io/js-find-a-pair-game/) 
**Ctrl/Command** + click to open a link in a new window

This is a game of finding matching pairs of pictures. There are three levels of difficulty, a timer, a small sound effect, and result tracking.

### Developing this project, I practiced the following:
* working with functions (writing main and auxiliary functions)
* flag variables
* data attributes and adding elements to the page based on their values
* conditional styling
* Event listeners. While working with them, I encountered a problem where a certain event (click) wasn't triggered on child elements. I was able to quickly identify this problem and found a solution by searching for it online.

The main difficulty in working on this project was in developing the logic for comparing cards. I solved this problem by breaking it down into smaller sub-tasks. This way, I was able to create a logical chain of actions that ultimately fulfilled all the intended functionality.
